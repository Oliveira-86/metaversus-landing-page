# Metaversus

#### In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web. Because it's so important to a business, landing pages that look great and have a good user experience are of paramount importance. Thinking about that, I created this website with animation and a modern and responsive designer with the stacks Next.js 13, Tailmind css, and Frame Motion.
